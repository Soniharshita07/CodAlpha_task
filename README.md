# 1.🌸 Iris Flower Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**.

It is one of the most popular beginner-friendly classification projects in machine learning, and it demonstrates the end-to-end process of **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

* To classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.
* To explore the dataset visually and understand relationships between features.
* To train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

---

## 🧠 Key Skills Used

* Data Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Machine Learning Classification
* Model Evaluation
* Data Visualization

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information on:

* State and Region
* Date of observation
* Estimated unemployment rate (%)
* Labour participation rate
* Estimated employed and unemployed numbers

**Source:** Dataset provided by CodeAlpha or open-source employment statistics.

---

## 📊 Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Imported the dataset using Pandas and handled missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Checked data distribution, outliers, and statistical summaries.
3. **Visualization** – Plotted various charts to represent state-wise and monthly unemployment trends.
4. **Insights** – Derived key takeaways to explain unemployment dynamics.

---


## 🔍 Key Insights

* Certain states showed consistently higher unemployment rates throughout the year.
* Unemployment fluctuated seasonally, possibly due to agricultural cycles and pandemic effects.
* The labour participation rate had an inverse relationship with unemployment rate in some regions.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This analysis provided a clear understanding of how unemployment varies geographically and temporally.
It demonstrates practical applications of **EDA, data visualization, and interpretation** for socio-economic data.
